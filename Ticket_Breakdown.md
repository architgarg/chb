# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

-[ ] The custom ID field is validated for uniqueness and length constraints

#### Implementation Details:

-[ ] Write a database migration script to add the custom_id column to the Agents table
-[ ] Update the API endpoints and backend code to accept and store custom IDs
-[ ] Update the report generation code to display the custom ID
-[ ] Write unit and integration tests for the new functionality

**Effort Estimate** : 4-6 hours

-[ ] Update the report template to display the custom ID
-[ ] Write unit and integration tests to ensure the custom ID is included in the report

**Effort Estimate**: 4-6 hours

## Ticket 4: Validate Custom ID Field Input

**Description**: Implement server-side validation for the custom ID field to ensure it meets length and uniqueness constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

-[ ] The custom ID field input is validated to ensure it meets length constraints
-[ ] The custom ID is validated for uniqueness in the Facility's Agent list

#### Implementation Details:

-[ ] Add server-side validation to the API endpoints that allow Facilities to set custom IDs for their Agents
-[ ] Write unit and integration tests to ensure the validation rules are enforced

**Effort Estimate**: 4-6 hours

-[ ] The custom ID field is included in the report generation UI

#### Implementation Details:

-[ ] Update the Facility UI to include a custom ID field for each Agent
-[ ] Implement client-side validation to enforce length and uniqueness constraints
-[ ] Modify the report generation UI to display the custom ID for each Agent
-[ ] Write unit and integration tests for the new functionality

**Effort Estimate**: 4-6 hours
